Practical Reverse Engineering
=============================
I'm currently reading the book 
*Practical Reverse Engineering* by Bruce Dang, Alexandre Gazet 
and Elias Bachaalany (ISBN: [1118787315](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118787315.html)).

An essential part of the book are exercises. They are quite 
challenging, especially for someone new to the field of reverse 
engineering. The book doesn't have solutions, but encourage
the reader to share their results. This is what I'm doing on
[my blog](http://www.johannesbader.ch/projects/solutions-to-practical-reverse-engineering/). 
You can find all accompanying material like source code in this
repository.

Again, I'm very inexperienced with reverse engineering and my
results likely contain errors, but I hope you might still find
them useful.  If you have any corrections or remarks, I'll 
appreciate if you post them here or under the blog posts.
